# File I/O Part 1 Exercises (Pair)

## Word Count

Write a program that asks for a filesystem path for a text file and reads the contents of the file. After processing the file, it displays both the number of words and the number of sentences in the file.

* Rule 1: Words are delimited by space characters or the end of a sentence.
* Rule 2: Sentences are terminated by either a period, an exclamation mark, or a question mark. Blank lines are not counted as a sentence.

Use `alices_adventures_in_wonderland.txt` for test input.

Once you have arrived at a word count and sentance count for the provided file, post your result on Ryver.
